### Flowers Recognition
[Code](khl/DLProjects/blob/main/FlowersRecognition.ipynb)

This is a multi-class classification problem from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition).
Based on the image of the flower, you need to determine the name of the flower.

To solve this problem, fine tuning of the resnet50 model was used.
Accuracy on test (dataset is balanced): 0.99

Here is an example of how a trained neural network works:

### Vehicle segmentation
[code](https://github.com/gitmskhl/DLProjects/blob/main/CarSegmentation.ipynb)
Based on the image of the car, it is necessary to carry out semantic segmentation into 2 classes: car and background.

U-NET model is used. 
Here is an example of how a trained network works
